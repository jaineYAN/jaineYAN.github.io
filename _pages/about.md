## About Me

I'm a second-year MPhil student at [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)](https://hkust.edu.hk/). My research focuses on **Human–Computer Interaction and Ergonomics**. Currently, I am working on **Smart Assistive Technology Design to Empower Older Adults (i.e., Seniors) to Cope with Motor, Cognitive, Emotional, and Social Challenges**. 

I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Dengbo He](https://ce.hkust.edu.hk/people/dengbo-he-hedengbo) and [Prof. Mingming Fan](https://www.mingmingfan.com/) at HKUST. My current research examines the cognitive load in interactions between older adults and Level 3 autonomous driving systems. Additionally, I collaborate with Tsinghua University on a project exploring cognitive training for older adults through product prototyping. 

During my studies, I have interned as a UX/UI design intern at companies such as **NetEase**, **Syncore**, and **Inceptio Technology**, where I gained a deep understanding of design workflows and demonstrated strong problem-solving abilities. 

I am proficient in design tools such as **Sketch**, **Adobe XD**, **Figma**, **Axure**, **Rhino**, **Blender**, **Midjourney**, **Photoshop (PS)**, **Illustrator**, and **Keyshot**.

My research interests include **accessibility** and **virtual reality (VR)**. I received my bachelor's degree in **Industrial Design** from [Taiyuan University of Technology](https://www.tyut.edu.cn/), where I was awarded multiple scholarships.
